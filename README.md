#  Emotion Detection using AI

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect emotions from human facial expressions in real-time using a webcam.

---

## Features

- Real-time face detection with OpenCV
- Emotion classification using a trained CNN
- Pre-trained model included (zipped)

---

## Model

Due to GitHub size limits, the model is zipped as `model.zip`.

###  To use:

1. Unzip the model:

```bash
unzip model.zip
